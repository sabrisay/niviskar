Subject: Invitation to KT Session on QA1 Environment Onboarding for EKS Migration

Dear Team,

As part of our ongoing application migration to EKS, we are now focused on onboarding microservices for the QA1 environment. So far, we have successfully onboarded six applications.

We would like to invite you to a knowledge transfer (KT) session aimed at providing a comprehensive understanding of the onboarding process, new tooling, and overall application management in the EKS environment. Attending this session will not only help you navigate the changes effectively but also ensure a smoother transition for your applications.

Helpful links and resources related to this migration effort are shared below for your reference. Please feel free to forward this invite to anyone else you believe would benefit from attending.

We are targeting to complete this migration by the end of Q1 and appreciate your participation to make this initiative a success.

Looking forward to your presence and engagement during the session.

Best regards,
